# This is YAML. If you don't know about YAML, you need to know that spaces are used for indentation. Whitespace width defines sections

configurations:
   # We lean on YAML includes to define a base template
   # All checks referring to this base_config will inherent its parameters
   # As this block has no "message" attribute we assume this config cannot be called by Nagios. You can overwrite these attributes in 
   # extending configurations.

      # Also, throw an unknown status if the log file change date is older than this time in either minutes (..m), hours (..h) or days (..d)
      stalealert: 60d

      # Next, you could filter based on a date / time field. This requires 3 fields:
      # - the date column of the log line, assuming a tab or space seperated file such as a access log. Comma seperate a second column if the
      #   the time is in another column, the script will concatenate them with a space
      # - the format of these dates in the loggile in quotes, using Python date format conventions.
      #   Seperate date and time with a space if they are in 2 columns
      #     https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-behavior
      # - and finally, which to include in either minutes (<number>m), hours (h) or days (d)
      # Note that you can use datecolumn and dateformat in a template and dateage in a check
